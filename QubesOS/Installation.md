## Issues

### Laptop restarts after a few minutes of interactions with the installer

#### Brief description

After a few moments interacting with the installer, the screen goes black and my laptop restarts. This happens both with Legacy and UEFI boot. It takes about one minute to get to Ananconda and another minute for it to freeze and trigger a reboot.

#### Using the basic graphics installer in Legacy mode

Unfortunately, X fails to startup.
```
